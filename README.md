## Introduction

Ever wanted to find which restaurants have the best house-made ranch dressing? Ranch Ratings is here for you:

- Find the geographical location of the eating establishment you wish to rate
- Post ratings of 1 to 5 stars as well as comments pertaining to a restaurantâ€™s "ranch" performance
- Track which establishments are receiving the highest ratings in your area
- Develop a profile and meet other ranch afficionados

Use your android device to create your own profile.  Use the search function, or geo-locater to find the establishment you wish to rate.  Scroll through the "news feed" to determine what restaurants are performing the best.  Log user history and ratings to develop a reputation.
